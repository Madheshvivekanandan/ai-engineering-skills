# Python Best Practices (Enterprise Standard)

Opinionated synthesis of Google Python Style Guide, PEP 8/257, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy,
pytest, ruff/black/mypy, OWASP, Clean Architecture, SOLID, and DDD.
Target runtime: **Python 3.12+**. When this document conflicts with an existing
in-repo convention, follow the repo and say so.

## 1. General Philosophy

- **Readability over cleverness.** Code is read far more than written. No one-liner golf.
- **Explicit over implicit.** No hidden globals, no magic monkey-patching, no `**kwargs` pass-through where real parameters belong.
- **Single Responsibility.** One reason to change per function, class, and module.
- **Small units.** If you cannot name it precisely, it does too much.
- **Fail loudly, early.** Validate at boundaries; trust data inside the core.
- **Dependencies point inward.** Domain logic never imports web/DB frameworks.
- **No premature optimization.** Optimize only with a measurement in hand; correctness and clarity first.
- **Delete rather than comment out.** Version control is the archive.
- **Boring is a feature.** Prefer the stdlib and the framework's idiom over a novel abstraction.

## 2. Project Structure

```
app/
  main.py            # ASGI app factory, middleware, router registration only
  api/               # HTTP layer: routers, dependencies, error handlers
    v1/routes/
    deps.py
  services/          # Use cases / business logic. Orchestrates repositories.
  repositories/      # All persistence access. Only layer that touches Session.
  models/            # SQLAlchemy ORM entities (persistence shape)
  schemas/           # Pydantic request/response DTOs (wire shape)
  domain/            # Pure business types, value objects, domain exceptions (no I/O)
  core/              # Settings, logging config, security, constants
  db/                # Engine/session factory, base metadata, migrations/ (Alembic)
  clients/           # Outbound HTTP/queue/third-party adapters
  utils/             # Small, generic, dependency-free helpers
tests/
  unit/  integration/  e2e/  conftest.py  factories/
```

**Layer rules (enforced in review):**

| Layer | May depend on | Must never |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | `schemas`, `services`, `deps` | touch `Session`, ORM models, or SQL |
| `services` | `repositories`, `domain`, `clients` | import FastAPI, `Request`, or `HTTPException` |
| `repositories` | `models`, `db` | contain business rules |
| `domain` | stdlib only | import SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, Pydantic-web concerns |
| `utils` | stdlib | import `app.*` |

- `models` ≠ `schemas`. Never return an ORM object from a route; map to a response schema.
- One module per aggregate/feature, not one per pattern, once a layer exceeds ~10 files
  (`services/orders/`, `services/invoicing/`).

## 3. Naming Conventions

| Kind | Convention | Good | Bad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Module / package | `snake_case`, singular noun | `order_service.py` | `OrderUtils.py`, `helpers2.py` |
| Class | `PascalCase` noun | `CreditLimitPolicy` | `credit_mgr`, `DoStuff` |
| Function / method | `snake_case` verb phrase | `reserve_inventory()` | `inventory()`, `handleIt()` |
| Boolean | `is_/has_/can_/should_` | `is_credit_blocked` | `flag`, `status2` |
| Variable | `snake_case`, domain word | `unpaid_invoices` | `data`, `tmp`, `l`, `res` |
| Constant | `UPPER_SNAKE` at module top | `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | `maxRetries` |
| Enum | `PascalCase` class, `UPPER_SNAKE` members | `OrderStatus.AWAITING_CREDIT` | `OrderStatus.s1` |
| Private | leading `_` | `_normalize_gstin()` | `normalizeGSTIN2()` |
| Type alias | `PascalCase` | `type OrderId = int` | `orderid_t` |
| Test | `test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected>` | `test_reserve_inventory_when_out_of_stock_raises()` | `test_1()` |

- Never shadow builtins (`id`, `type`, `list`, `input`, `dict`).
- Avoid abbreviations except universally known ones (`id`, `url`, `http`, `db`, `gst`).
- Units and currency belong in the name: `timeout_seconds`, `amount_inr_paise`.
- Plural names for collections only.

## 4. Imports

- **Absolute imports only** for first-party code: `from app.services.orders import OrderService`.
  Relative imports are acceptable only inside a tightly-cohesive package (`from .policy import ...`).
- Ordering (ruff/isort enforced): stdlib → third-party → first-party → local. One import per line for modules.
- **No wildcard imports.** `from x import *` is banned, including in `__init__.py`.
- Import modules or explicit names, not "everything from a barrel". Keep `__init__.py` thin;
  re-export a curated public API only, and define `__all__` when you do.
- `if TYPE_CHECKING:` for import-only-for-annotations; combine with `from __future__ import annotations`
  when needed for forward refs.
- **Circular dependencies are a design smell, not an import problem.** Fix by moving the shared
  type into `domain/`, or by depending on a Protocol defined in the inner layer and implemented
  outward. Local (function-scoped) imports are a last resort and must carry a comment saying why.
- No side effects at import time: no DB connections, no network calls, no `load_dotenv()` in library modules.

## 5. Functions

- **Target ≤ 30 lines, ≤ 4 parameters, cyclomatic complexity ≤ 8.** Past that, extract.
- **Type hints are mandatory** on every parameter and return value, including `-> None`.
- Keyword-only for optional/boolean parameters: `def send(*, dry_run: bool = False) -> None:`.
  Never pass a bare boolean positionally.
- **Never use mutable defaults.** Use `None` + in-body default, or an immutable default.
- Return early; avoid deep nesting. Prefer a guard clause over `else`.
- One return type. Don't return `Order | None | bool` — raise instead of returning a sentinel.
- **Prefer pure functions** for calculation; isolate I/O in thin shells ("functional core, imperative shell").
- No output parameters (don't mutate caller-owned arguments) unless the name says so (`_in_place`).

```python
def allocate_credit(
    order: Order,
    profile: CreditProfile,
    *,
    allow_override: bool = False,
) -> CreditDecision:
    """Decide how much credit to grant for an order.

    Args:
        order: Order awaiting credit clearance.
        profile: Customer's current credit standing.
        allow_override: Permit exceeding the sanctioned limit for priority accounts.

    Returns:
        The granted amount and the reason code driving the decision.

    Raises:
        CreditProfileStaleError: If the profile snapshot predates the order.
    """
```

## 6. Classes

- Create a class when behaviour and state travel together, or to satisfy a Protocol/port.
  **A class with one method and no state should be a function.**
- `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)` for value objects; Pydantic `BaseModel` only at
  I/O boundaries (validation/serialization); plain classes for services with injected collaborators.
- **Composition over inheritance.** Inherit only for genuine `is-a` or to implement an ABC.
  Depth ≤ 2. No mixin stacks that share mutable state.
- **Dependency Injection via `__init__`.** Never construct collaborators (sessions, HTTP clients,
  settings) inside a class — accept them. This is what makes tests cheap.
- No God objects: a class over ~200 lines or with >7 public methods is being split.
- `@property` for cheap derived reads only; anything with I/O or cost is a method.
- Define `__repr__` for debuggability; never put secrets in it.

```python
class OrderService:
    def __init__(
        self,
        orders: OrderRepository,
        credit: CreditPolicy,
        events: EventPublisher,
    ) -> None:
        self._orders = orders
        self._credit = credit
        self._events = events
```

## 7. Type Safety

- Annotate everything public. mypy runs in **strict** mode; new code must not add ignores.
- Modern syntax: `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `str | None`, `type Alias = ...` (PEP 695).
  Not `List`, `Dict`, `Optional[str]`, `Union[...]`.
- `X | None` means "genuinely absent". Don't use it to dodge error handling.
- **`Protocol` for ports** (structural typing) instead of ABCs, so the inner layer owns the interface
  and outer adapters satisfy it without importing it.
- Generics via PEP 695: `class Repository[T]: ...`, `def first[T](items: Sequence[T]) -> T | None: ...`.
- `TypedDict` for fixed-shape dicts crossing boundaries (external JSON); `NewType` for IDs
  (`type CustomerId = NewType("CustomerId", int)`) to stop mixing them up.
- `Literal` + `Enum` instead of magic strings. `Final` for module constants.
- **`Any` requires a comment justifying it.** `object` + narrowing, or `cast()` at a single
  well-marked seam, is preferred. `# type: ignore[code]` must name the error code and a reason.
- Narrow with `assert isinstance(...)` only in tests; in production use explicit checks that raise.

## 8. Error Handling

- Define a small exception hierarchy per bounded context, rooted in one app base:

```python
class AppError(Exception):
    """Base for all application errors."""

class DomainError(AppError):
    """Business rule violated — caller's input is semantically wrong."""

class CreditLimitExceededError(DomainError):
    def __init__(self, requested: Decimal, available: Decimal) -> None:
        super().__init__(f"requested {requested} exceeds available {available}")
        self.requested = requested
        self.available = available
```

- **Raise domain exceptions from services; translate to HTTP only in the API layer**
  (`@app.exception_handler`). Services must not know status codes.
- Catch the **narrowest** exception type. `except Exception` is permitted only at a top-level
  boundary (request handler, worker loop, CLI entrypoint) and must log with `exc_info=True` and re-raise or fail the unit of work.
- **Never swallow.** `except: pass` and bare `except:` are banned. If an error is truly
  ignorable, log at `debug` and comment why.
- **Always chain:** `raise OrderNotFoundError(order_id) from exc`. Use `from None` only to
  deliberately hide an internal cause from a caller.
- Error messages: state what failed and the identifying value; **never** include secrets, tokens,
  PII, or raw SQL.
- `try` blocks wrap the smallest possible statement set. Cleanup via `finally` or context managers,
  not duplicated code.
- Retries only for genuinely transient faults, with bounded attempts + jittered backoff + idempotency.

## 9. Logging

- One module-level logger: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. **`print()` is banned** in
  application code (CLI user-facing output excepted).
- **Structured logging** — key/value extras, not string concatenation, so logs are queryable:
  `logger.info("order_credit_blocked", extra={"order_id": order.id, "shortfall": str(gap)})`.
- Use lazy `%s` formatting (`logger.info("synced %s rows", n)`) — never f-strings in log calls.
- **Correlation IDs**: generate/propagate a request ID in middleware, store in a `ContextVar`,
  inject into every log record via a `logging.Filter`, and forward it on outbound calls
  (`X-Request-ID`).
- **Mask sensitive data** at the logging layer (a redacting filter), not by trusting call sites.
  Never log: passwords, tokens, API keys, full card/bank numbers, OTPs, auth headers, full request bodies.
- Levels: `DEBUG` dev detail · `INFO` business milestones · `WARNING` recoverable/degraded ·
  `ERROR` failed operation needing attention · `CRITICAL` process-level failure. No `INFO` inside loops.
- Configure handlers/format **once** at app startup (`core/logging.py`); libraries and modules
  never call `basicConfig`.

## 10. Security (OWASP)

- **Injection:** parameterized queries / ORM constructs only. Never f-string or `%` user input into
  SQL, shell, LDAP, or template strings. If raw SQL is unavoidable, use `text()` with bound params.
- **Command execution:** `subprocess.run([...], shell=False)` with a list argv. `shell=True`,
  `os.system`, `eval`, `exec`, `pickle.loads` on untrusted data are banned.
- **Secrets:** environment/secret manager only, loaded through a typed `Settings`
  (`pydantic-settings`). **No hardcoded credentials, keys, or connection strings** — not even in
  tests, defaults, or comments. Never commit `.env`. Use `SecretStr` and keep secrets out of
  `repr`/logs/tracebacks.
- **Input validation** at the boundary with Pydantic: exact types, `constr`/`Field` bounds,
  `extra="forbid"`, allow-lists over deny-lists. Validate file uploads by size/type/content, not extension.
- **AuthN:** vetted libraries only. Passwords via Argon2id/bcrypt (never SHA/MD5). JWTs: verify
  signature + `alg` + `aud` + `iss` + `exp`; short TTL; no secrets in the payload. Use `secrets`,
  never `random`, for tokens; compare with `hmac.compare_digest`.
- **AuthZ:** enforce on every endpoint via a dependency; **deny by default**. Check object-level
  ownership/tenancy in the service or repository query (`WHERE tenant_id = :tenant`), not just role —
  IDOR is the default bug otherwise.
- **Output encoding:** let the framework serialize JSON; autoescape templates; never build HTML by
  concatenation. Set security headers and a strict CORS allow-list (no `allow_origins=["*"]` with credentials).
- **Transport & data:** TLS with certificate verification on (never `verify=False`), encrypt sensitive
  data at rest, minimize PII collected and retained.
- **SSRF/path traversal:** validate and allow-list outbound URLs; resolve and confine file paths
  (`Path.resolve().is_relative_to(base)`).
- Generic error responses to clients; details to logs. No stack traces or SQL in API responses;
  `DEBUG=False` in production.
- Pin dependencies with a lockfile; run `pip-audit`/`safety` and `ruff`'s security rules (`S`, i.e. bandit) in CI.

## 11. Database (SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic)

- **Repository pattern:** repositories expose intent-named methods
  (`find_unpaid_by_customer(customer_id)`), return domain/ORM objects, and are the **only** place
  `Session`/`select()` appears. No `Session` in routers or services' signatures beyond passing it to repos.
- **2.0 style:** `select()` + `session.execute(...).scalars()`, `DeclarativeBase` with
  `Mapped[...]` / `mapped_column(...)`. Avoid legacy `Query` and implicit autoflush surprises.
- **Transactions:** one transaction per unit of work, owned by the **service** (or a
  `unit_of_work` context manager) — repositories never commit. Use `with session.begin():` and let
  exceptions roll back. Never `commit()` inside a loop over records.
- **Session lifecycle:** one session per request via a FastAPI dependency
  (`yield` + `finally: close()`); never a module-global session; sessions are not thread/task-safe.
  Configure `pool_size`, `max_overflow`, `pool_pre_ping=True`, `pool_recycle`.
- **Parameterized always.** `text("... WHERE id = :id")` with `{"id": id}`.
- **Relationships:** set `lazy="raise"` (or `raise_on_sql`) by default so N+1 fails loudly; load
  explicitly with `selectinload`/`joinedload`. Always define `back_populates` and an explicit
  `cascade`/`passive_deletes` policy.
- **Concurrency:** use `with_for_update()` or optimistic versioning (`version_id_col`) for
  read-modify-write on money/stock. Make writes idempotent where retries are possible.
- **Migrations:** every schema change ships an Alembic revision, reviewed, with a working
  `downgrade()`. Autogenerate then **hand-edit**. Backfills are separate, batched, idempotent
  migrations/scripts. Expand → migrate → contract for zero-downtime; never rename/drop a column in
  the same release that stops using it. No destructive DDL without an explicit sign-off note.
- Money as `Numeric`/`Decimal` (or integer minor units) — never `float`. Timestamps as timezone-aware UTC.
- Index every foreign key and every column used in a hot `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`; add `UNIQUE`
  constraints for real business keys. Constraints in the DB, not only in Python.

## 12. FastAPI

- **Thin routers.** A handler validates input via schema, calls one service method, returns a
  response model. Target ≤ 15 lines and **zero** business logic, `if` chains, or SQL.
- **Never touch the database from a router.** Route → service → repository, always.
- **Dependency Injection** for session, current user, settings, and services (`Annotated[X, Depends(...)]`).
  Use `dependencies=[Depends(require_role(...))]` at router level for cross-cutting auth.
- **Response models** on every route: `response_model=OrderOut`, `status_code=...`,
  `response_model_exclude_none` where useful. Separate `...In` / `...Out` / `...Patch` schemas —
  never accept the same model you emit, and never expose ORM objects or internal fields.
- Register `@app.exception_handler` for `DomainError`, validation errors, and a catch-all → RFC-7807
  style JSON. Don't scatter `HTTPException` through services.
- `async def` handlers when the work is I/O-bound and awaitable; **plain `def` when the work is
  blocking** (FastAPI runs it in a threadpool) — a blocking call inside `async def` stalls the loop.
- **BackgroundTasks** only for short, fire-and-forget, failure-tolerant work (emails, cache warm).
  Anything retryable, long, or business-critical goes to a real queue/worker.
- Pagination (`limit`/`offset` or cursor) and explicit `max` bounds on every list endpoint.
- Lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown; version the API (`/api/v1`); tag and document routes.
- Middleware for request ID, timing, and error boundary — not for business rules.

## 13. Async Programming

- Async for **I/O-bound concurrency** (HTTP, DB, queues). CPU-bound work goes to
  `ProcessPoolExecutor` or a worker, never inline in the event loop.
- **Never block the loop:** no `time.sleep`, `requests`, blocking DB drivers, or heavy file I/O in
  `async def`. Use `asyncio.sleep`, `httpx.AsyncClient`, async drivers (`asyncpg`), or wrap legacy
  blocking calls in `await asyncio.to_thread(...)`.
- **Don't mix stacks.** One project, one choice: sync SQLAlchemy + sync routes, or `AsyncSession` +
  async routes. `AsyncSession` is not shareable across concurrent tasks.
- Concurrency with `asyncio.TaskGroup` (3.11+) — it propagates errors and cancels siblings.
  `gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` only when you deliberately handle partial failure.
- Never fire-and-forget a bare `asyncio.create_task` — keep a reference, await it, or use a TaskGroup,
  or it gets garbage-collected and its exception vanishes.
- Every outbound call gets a timeout (`asyncio.timeout()` / client timeout). Treat
  `asyncio.CancelledError` as cancellation: clean up and re-raise, never swallow it.
- Reuse one `AsyncClient`/pool for the app lifetime; use `async with` for all async resources.
- Guard shared mutable state with `asyncio.Lock`; use `ContextVar` (not globals) for request-scoped context.

## 14. Performance

- **N+1 is the default bug.** Eager-load with `selectinload`, or fetch parents then children in one
  `IN` query. `lazy="raise"` makes violations impossible to miss.
- Select only the columns you need for wide tables (`select(Order.id, Order.total)`).
- **Bulk operations** for volume: `insert().values([...])`, `session.execute(update(...))`,
  `bulk_insert_mappings`, `COPY` for very large loads. Never a per-row loop with a commit.
- **Pagination everywhere** — keyset/cursor pagination for large or deep result sets (`OFFSET` degrades linearly).
- **Stream, don't accumulate:** generators, `yield`, `session.stream()`/`yield_per()`, chunked file
  reads, `StreamingResponse` for large exports. Never `.all()` an unbounded table into memory.
- **Cache** with an explicit key, TTL, and invalidation story: `functools.lru_cache`/`cache` for pure
  in-process functions, Redis for shared/cross-process. Never cache per-user data under a global key.
- Prefer set/dict lookups over list scans in loops; hoist invariant work out of loops; use
  `__slots__`/frozen dataclasses for high-cardinality objects.
- Measure before optimizing (`cProfile`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, timing logs) and state the numbers in
  the PR. Add an index before adding a cache.

## 15. Testing

- **pytest** only. `tests/` mirrors `app/`. `test_<module>.py`, `test_<unit>_<scenario>_<expected>()`.
- **AAA structure** (arrange/act/assert), one behaviour per test, assert on outcomes not internals.
- **Unit tests** for services/domain: fast, no DB, no network — fake repositories via Protocols.
- **Integration tests** for repositories/migrations/routes: real DB (testcontainers or a disposable
  schema), transaction-rollback fixtures for isolation, `TestClient`/`httpx.ASGITransport` for the app.
- **Mock at the boundary you own** (repository, client interface) — not deep internals, and never
  mock the thing under test. Prefer fakes/stubs over `MagicMock` for anything with behaviour.
  `respx`/`responses` for HTTP; never hit real third parties.
- **Cover the edges:** empty, one, many; boundary values; `None`/missing; duplicates; unicode;
  Decimal rounding; timezone/DST; concurrent update; permission denied; upstream timeout;
  and every raised exception path.
- Deterministic: freeze time (`freezegun`/injected clock), seed randomness, no `sleep`, no ordering
  dependence between tests, no shared mutable module state.
- `pytest.mark.parametrize` instead of copy-pasted cases. Factories/builders (`factory_boy` or plain
  helpers) instead of giant literal fixtures. Markers for `slow`/`integration`.
- **Coverage: ≥ 85% overall, ~100% on services/domain**, and every bug fix ships a regression test
  that fails before the fix. Coverage is a floor, not the goal — assertions matter more than lines.

## 16. Code Quality Gates

Before code is "complete", all of these pass locally and in CI:

```bash
ruff format .                 # formatting (or: black .)
ruff check --fix .            # lint: E,F,I,N,UP,B,S,SIM,C4,RET,ARG,PTH,ASYNC,ANN
mypy app                      # strict: no new ignores, no untyped defs
pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=85 -q
pip-audit                     # known CVEs in dependencies
alembic upgrade head          # migrations apply cleanly (+ downgrade tested)
```

- Config lives in `pyproject.toml`; line length 100 (or the repo's existing value). Black/ruff-format
  is the sole authority on formatting — never hand-format or argue with it.
- Pre-commit hooks run format, lint, type-check, and secret detection.
- **Zero warnings, zero skipped tests, zero new `# noqa`/`# type: ignore` without a reason comment.**
  A failing gate is not "unrelated" until proven so.

## 17. Documentation

- **PEP 257 docstrings** (Google style) on every public module, class, and function. Skip only where
  the signature is genuinely self-explanatory and trivial. Imperative mood, one-line summary, then
  `Args`/`Returns`/`Raises` — document every raised exception.
- Docstrings say **why and what contract**; the code already says how. Never restate the signature.
- **Inline comments only for non-obvious rationale** — a business rule, a workaround with a link, a
  deliberate perf trade-off. Delete commented-out code and "TODO" without an owner/ticket.
- Update the README/`docs/` when you add a setup step, env var, command, or service. New env vars are
  documented in `.env.example` in the same change.
- FastAPI: `summary`, `description`, `response_model`, `responses={...}` and schema `Field(examples=...)`
  so OpenAPI is the API doc. Keep it truthful — a stale example is worse than none.
- Record non-obvious architectural decisions as a short ADR in `docs/adr/`.
- Type hints replace type documentation; keep both consistent or drop the prose.

## 18. AI Agent Rules

When writing or modifying Python, the agent **must**:

1. **Read before writing.** Inspect neighbouring modules and match existing patterns, naming, and libraries. The repo's convention beats this document.
2. **Type-hint everything**, including `-> None`. No `Any` without a justifying comment.
3. **Respect the layering.** Route → service → repository. **Never** access the DB from a router, never put business logic in a router or repository, never import FastAPI in a service.
4. **Never bypass the service layer**, even for "just a quick read".
5. **Generate tests with the code** — unit tests for every new branch of business logic, plus a failing-then-passing regression test for every bug fix.
6. **Never invent business rules.** If credit limits, tax treatment, rounding, statuses, or SLAs are ambiguous, **ask** — do not guess and do not silently pick a default.
7. **State assumptions explicitly** in the response when proceeding under uncertainty, and mark them in code with a comment only where they affect behaviour.
8. **Never hardcode secrets, credentials, endpoints, or environment values.** Read from typed settings; add to `.env.example`.
9. **Handle errors deliberately.** No bare `except`, no `pass`, always chain with `from`.
10. **Ship the migration** with any model change; never edit an applied Alembic revision.
11. **Keep changes minimal and focused.** No drive-by refactors, no reformatting untouched files, no renaming public APIs unasked. One logical change per commit, imperative subject line, and no commits unless the user asked.
12. **Preserve backward compatibility** on public APIs and DB schemas; if a break is unavoidable, say so loudly and propose the expand/contract path.
13. **Do not add dependencies** without saying why and confirming; prefer stdlib.
14. **Run the gates** (format, lint, mypy, tests) and report real output. Never claim verification you didn't perform; if a gate fails, say so with the output.
15. **Delete dead code you create**; don't leave scaffolding, debug prints, or `print()` behind.
16. **Flag anything security-relevant** you touch (auth, tenancy, input handling, SQL, file paths, outbound URLs) in the summary.

## 19. Review Checklist

For an AI reviewer. Flag only real defects; cite `file:line` and state the failure scenario.

**Architecture** — layer boundaries respected? DB accessed only from repositories? services free of framework imports? no circular deps? unit sized right (function ≤30 lines, class ≤200)? duplication that should be extracted — or premature abstraction that shouldn't?

**Security** — any string-interpolated SQL/shell/path? secrets or tokens hardcoded or logged? input validated at the boundary with bounds and `extra="forbid"`? authn *and* object-level authz (tenant/owner) enforced on every new endpoint? `verify=False`, `shell=True`, `eval`, `pickle`? errors leaking internals to clients?

**Type safety** — full annotations? new `Any`/`cast`/`# type: ignore` justified? `X | None` handled at every use? mypy strict clean?

**Error handling** — narrowest exception caught? nothing swallowed? chained with `from`? domain errors mapped to HTTP once, in the API layer? messages free of secrets/PII?

**Logging** — no `print`? structured extras, lazy formatting? correlation ID present? sensitive fields masked? level appropriate and not logging inside hot loops?

**Database** — transaction boundary owned by the service, one per unit of work? no commit in a loop? session lifecycle bound to the request? migration included with a real `downgrade`? indexes/constraints for new columns and FKs? `Decimal` for money, UTC-aware datetimes? concurrent-update safety on balances/stock?

**Performance** — N+1 introduced? unbounded query or `.all()` on a large table? missing pagination? per-row loop that should be bulk? cache key/TTL/invalidation sound? large payload streamed?

**Testing** — new logic covered, including error paths and edge cases? tests deterministic (no time/random/sleep/order dependence)? asserting behaviour, not implementation? mocks at owned boundaries only? regression test present for a bug fix?

**Readability** — names precise, domain-accurate, no shadowed builtins? magic numbers/strings replaced by constants/enums? nesting shallow, early returns? dead code, stray debug, commented-out blocks removed?

**Backward compatibility** — public API/response shape/schema changes? nullable-vs-required flips? default behaviour changes? expand/contract path for destructive DDL?

**Documentation** — docstrings on new public surfaces, `Raises` accurate? new env vars in `.env.example`? README/OpenAPI updated? comments explain *why*?

**Linting** — format/ruff/mypy/pytest all green; no new suppressions without a reason.
